## House Price Prediction Model

Welcome to my first internship machine learning project! In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features, such as the size of the house, number of bedrooms, location, and more. This was part of my first internship, where I applied the concepts and skills I learned in machine learning to a real-world problem.

## Overview

This project uses **machine learning** techniques to predict the prices of houses based on a dataset with multiple features. The goal was to build an accurate predictive model that can be used in the real estate industry to estimate house prices.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to handle missing values, categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performed data analysis to understand the relationships between features and the target variable (price).
- **Model Building**: Implemented various machine learning models, including linear regression and decision trees, to predict house prices.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the models using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R² to select the best performing model.

## Skills Learned & Applied

- **Data Science & Machine Learning**:
  - Gained hands-on experience with data preprocessing, feature engineering, and scaling techniques.
  - Applied supervised learning algorithms like **Linear Regression**, **Decision Trees**, and **Random Forest**.
  - Worked with libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Scikit-learn** for data manipulation and machine learning.
  
- **Data Visualization**:
  - Leveraged **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization to gain insights into the data and relationships between features.
  
- **Model Tuning**:
  - Used techniques like **cross-validation**, **hyperparameter tuning**, and **grid search** to optimize models and improve performance.

- **Problem-Solving**:
  - Solved real-world problems by turning raw data into actionable insights, ultimately predicting house prices accurately.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook

## Why This Project Is Important

This project was not just about applying machine learning models, but also about working with real-world data, making decisions about data cleaning and feature engineering, and learning how to effectively communicate results. It shows my ability to handle a full machine learning pipeline — from raw data to a final, deployable model.

I believe this project showcases my problem-solving and analytical skills, along with my passion for applying machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems. It’s a great demonstration of what I can accomplish as I continue to grow in the field of machine learning and data science.
